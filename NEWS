# RQGIS 1.0.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Bugs
  * Making sure that RQGIS does not return the same result when using same parameters names (e.g., INPUT). See #82 and 494e666. Thanks to @lbusett for suggesting a solution.
  * Updating `random_points` in accordance with issue https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/685
  * `set_env()` now also searches for `qgis-ltr.bat`

## Features
  * new example data `comm` and `study_area` added
  * updating `install_guide` vignette


# RQGIS 1.0.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs:
  * Linux: `qgis_session_info()` now tries several times to find out about the installed GRASS version (`find` frequently fails at the first attempt when used witin a function), and additionally suppresses a confusing warning message regarding access rights (permission denied when trying to access points.shp, however these points are accessed regardless of this message since they are used to test if GRASS can be accessed which is the case).
  * If a user specifies simply a basename for an input or output file, `run_qgis()` will now look for this file in the working directory (`getwd()`) or save it to this locations (suggested by @rkrug).
  * Specifying all parameters of a QGIS geoalgorithm in the "wrong" order caused an error. Issue #87 and solved through https://github.com/jannes-m/RQGIS/commit/45aef93c22107b2f34ee5ce4aa16cec485fc9489 (@raff-k).
  * `qgis_session_info()` no longer prints the supported saga versions if there is nothing to report (method `supportedVersions` was deleted from `SagaAlgorithmProvider` since  QGIS 2.18.10).
  * `run_qgis()` accepts network addresses as filenames under Windows again (#735e856, @susanatfybr).
  * `run_qgis()`, `pass_args()` and `save_spatial_objects()` now have an additional parameter named `NA_flag`, which allows to specify a value for NAs when exporting rasters (issue #93 raised by @raff-k and solved through #9e74a4a ).

Features:
  * `get_args_man()`, `run_qgis()` and `pass_args()` now print which default options were chosen (suggested by @rkrug).
  * More extensive testing through a new test file (`test-paper-analysis`)
  * `get_grp()` was replaced by the more generic `get_extent()`. If a geoalgorithm requires an extent object it will be computed automatically from the provided input spatial objects (if not specified explicitly by the user) (#95).


RQGIS 1.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs:
  * making sure that `setup_win()` works properly when the working directory is a server (commit  ccc1baa & 263a1cf)
  * solving winslash problems occurring in conjunction with Python, e.g., when in tempdir() directory names start with \\n or \\t (see commits 484e1d3, 8befac3 and issue #71)
  * `set_env()` now uses forward instead of backward slashes (commit 8befac3 and issue #83)
  * making sure under Linux that the decimal operator is a colon not a comma with the help of Sys.setlocale (see commit f3c7e15)
  * making sure that default parameter values will not be overwritten by `RQGIS.check_args`  (commit 29fb26a and issue #79)
  * reticulate 1.1 caused some trouble due to json parsing in `conda_list()` (solved by: https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate/issues/100; @jjallaire).
  
Miscellaneous:
  * RQGIS now supports FreeBSD (#78, @rhurlin)

RQGIS 1.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:
  * merging python_funs.py and import_setup.py into python_funs.py
  * New function parameter `show_output_paths` in `run_qgis`. Setting it to `FALSE` suppresses the printing of the output file paths.
  * `random_points` is now an sf-object (required also some adjustments in run_qgis and our tests)
  * `run_qgis` doesn't print a space any longer if the Python message is empty
  * developing and improving test coverage
  * adding GDAL version to `qgis_session_info`
  * `load_output` now supports all GDAL-supported drivers. Of course, this depends on the system setup (#72).
  * deleting deprecated function arguments `show_msg` and `check_params` (`run_qgis`)
  * deleting deprecated function argument `ltr` (`set_env`)

RQGIS 1.0.0 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:
  * RQGIS now uses [reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate) to establish a tunnel to the QGIS Python API (instead of starting a new Python session each time a function is called; #59). Consequently, we had to rewrite all RQGIS functions. Internally, the Python session is established by calling the new function `open_app`. `open_app` in turn makes advantage of various new helper functions (`setup_win()`, `run_ini()`, `setup_linux()`, `setup_mac()`). Additionally, we put much of the Python code into inst/python. `import_setup` contains much of the necessary import statements to run QGIS from within R. `python_funs` contains the RQGIS class (#32) containing several methods to call from within R (`get_args_man()`, `open_help()`, `qgis_session_info()`, etc.).

Features:
  * The user can now specify QGIS geoalgorithm parameters as R named arguments using the ellipsis-argument `...` (#58).
  
  * We rewrote the `load_output`-argument of `run_qgis`. It is now a logical argument. If `TRUE`, `run_qgis()` will automatically load all the output layers explicitly specified by the user back into R (#60).
  
  * Extensive error-/misspecification checking. To do so, we now submit a Python-dictionary - containing all parameters and arguments - to `processing.runalg`. This also allows to check parameter names. Before the **args-argument simply converted our input in a list containing the arguments (but not the parameter names). Using the Python dictionary has the additional benefit that we no longer have to take care of the order in which the function parameters are specified. Besides, we now also make sure that the user can only specify available options. And if the user provides the verbal notation, `pass_args` internally converts this input in the corresponding number notation as required by the QGIS API (#64, @tim-salabim; #65).
  
  * RQGIS now supports simple features (`sf`; #43, @einvindhammers).
  
  * support for MultiParameterInput through two new helper functions `save_spatial_objects` and `get_grp` (https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/240303/defining-grass-region-in-rqgis)
  
  * RQGIS now supports QGIS `osgeo4mac` homebrew installations. This is also the recommended installation way from now on as it does not cause irritating error messages like the Kyngchaos QGIS binary. 
  
  * `find_algorithms` now accepts regular expressions as argument for its `search_term` parameter
  
  * `set_env()` now caches its output, so calling it a second time, will load the cached output. 
  
  * Under Windows `set_env()` now first searches the most likely places to find a QGIS installation.
  
  * changing `set_env`'s parameter name from `ltr` to `dev`. When having multiple homebrew installations on mac (LTR and dev), the user can select which one to use with the `dev` argument in `set_env()`. Default uses the LTR version.
  
  * `qgis_session_info()` now warns Linux users that they might have to use a softlink when using grass7 in conjunction with QGIS (#52, @thengl)
  
  * changing the default for parameter `options` from `FALSE` to `TRUE` in `get_args_man`
  
  * `reset_paths` tries to restore the PATH environment variable, i.e. at least to make sure that all paths within PATH will still be available after having run `open_app`.

Miscellaneous:
  * Adding new tests.

RQGIS 0.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General: 
  * `build_cmds` now retrieves the working directory on the command line from where the script has been called (temporary folder), and makes it the working directory at the end of the batch script. This ensures that py_cmd.py can be found and executed (necessary since QGIS 2.18.2 since they somehow change the wd in one of their .bat-files) (#26, @eivindhammers).
  
  * RQGIS now also does testing using the `testthat`-package (#20).
  
  * `run_qgis` stops if the user specifies one of the interactive QGIS Select-by operations.
  
  * `run_qgis` now stops if the output shapefile created by QGIS is empty.
  
  * `run_qgis`-message: Use qgis:creategrid instead of qgis:vectorgrid.
  
  * Fine-tuning of the documentation files
  
  * Deleting redundancies in functions `build_cmds`, `check_apps` and `execute_cmds`
  
  * Removing empty string from `find_algorithms` output
  
  * Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
  
  * vignette update (MacOSX and homebrew installation) (#14, @pat-s)

Bug fixes:
  * bug fix: we replaced `findstr` in `set_env` by the more general `%SystemRoot%\\System32\\findstr`
  
  * bug fix: when constructing the cmd-command (in `run_qgis`), we need to avoid "double" shell quotes. This happened e.g., with `grass7:r.viewshed`. Additionally, we made sure that None, True and False are not shellquoted.
  
  * bug fix: when determining the GRASS REGION PARAMETER in `run_qgis`. To extract the extent of a spatial object `ogrInfo` needs the layer name without the file extension. To do that we now use the `file_path_sans_ext` of the `tools` package instead of a simple `gsub`-command. Previously, we simply returned everything in front of a colon. This caused problems with file names such as gis.osm_roads_free_1.shp.
  
  * bug fix: `run_qgis` function argument `load_output` now checks if the QGIS output was really created before trying to load it.
  
  * bug fix: There was a problem when using QGIS/Grass on a MacOS. Deleting one bash statement (`paste0("export PATH='", qgis_env$root, "/Contents/MacOS/bin:$PATH'"))`) solved the problem.
  
  * bug fix: `qgis_session_info` now also runs on MacOS (#34)

RQGIS 0.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Initial CRAN release
